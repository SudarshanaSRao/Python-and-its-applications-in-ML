# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice - Python
Welcome to my repository where I practice coding various data structures and algorithms problems in Python. Most of these problems are from the University of Michigan's Coursera online Python programming course. This collection includes a variety of topics designed to strengthen my understanding and skills in computer science fundamentals.

## Introduction
This repository is a reflection of my personal journey as I work through problems related to data structures and algorithms. These problems cover key topics in computer science and are an essential part of building problem-solving skills. Each program is written in Python and aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding how these data structures and algorithms are implemented and optimized.

## Practiced Topics
Here are some of the core topics covered in this repository:

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)**
- **Graphs (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)**
- **Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Hashing**
- **Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)**
